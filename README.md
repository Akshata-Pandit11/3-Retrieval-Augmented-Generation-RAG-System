# 3-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-System

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI's language models and FAISS for vector-based document retrieval. The goal is to build an intelligent Q&A system that answers user queries based on custom documents (PDFs or text data), rather than relying solely on model pretraining.

🚀 Features
📄 Ingest and process PDFs for context-aware QA

🔍 FAISS vector store for fast document similarity search

🧠 OpenAI embeddings and GPT for generating accurate responses

🛠️ Modular and extensible architecture

🧪 End-to-end implementation in a Jupyter Notebook

🧰 Tech Stack
Python

LangChain

FAISS (vector store)

OpenAI API

PyMuPDF (for PDF reading)
