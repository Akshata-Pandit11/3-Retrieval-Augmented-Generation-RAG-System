# 3-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-System

This project demonstrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI's language models and FAISS for vector-based document retrieval. The goal is to build an intelligent Q&A system that answers user queries based on custom documents (PDFs or text data), rather than relying solely on model pretraining.

 Features
1. Ingest and process PDFs for context-aware QA
2. FAISS vector store for fast document similarity search

3. OpenAI embeddings and GPT for generating accurate responses

4. Modular and extensible architecture

5. End-to-end implementation in a Jupyter Notebook
